Telegram Scraping Bot
Telegram Scraping Bot is a Python-based bot built using the Aiogram library to interact with Telegram's API. The bot allows users to scrape information from Telegram channels, such as product prices, weather forecasts, and currency rates. Additionally, it offers various interactive features, like responding to user requests for information and handling multiple states to search and display data.

This bot leverages MongoDB for storing user data and integrates Google Translate for language translation. It is designed to perform automated scraping of various sources and respond with useful, dynamic content.

This bot is primarily built for scraping various types of information from external sources and providing it to users through Telegram messages. Key features include scraping product information from Hotline (a popular Ukrainian product search site), weather forecasts, and currency exchange rates.

The bot interacts with users using a custom-built keyboard interface, and it also performs various asynchronous tasks like fetching and sending information based on user commands.

Features
Hotline Product Search:
Users can search for products on Hotline by entering the product name. The bot scrapes product details like the price and image, then displays them with comparison buttons.

Currency Rate:
Users can check current currency exchange rates, including the buying and selling rates for different currencies.

Weather Information:
The bot fetches weather data for any city and translates the results into Ukrainian using Google Translate.

Bot Information:
The bot provides information about itself when requested by the user. This includes details about the bot‚Äôs functionality, technology stack, and a link for feedback.

Interactive Interface:
The bot uses Aiogram's FSM (Finite State Machine) to handle various states like searching products, entering weather cities, and more.

User Data Management:
The bot saves user data, including their Telegram ID, first and last name, and language code, to MongoDB.

Admin Features:
The bot can send test messages to users in the database, helping administrators verify bot functionality or send updates.
